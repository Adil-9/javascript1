	<p id="parag">Does she need to be an empathetic leader? Ask about that. Does she need to 
take your company public? Ask about that. If you're the candidate, talk about why 
you took certain jobs. Explain why you left. Explain why you chose a certain 
school. Share why you decided to go to grad school. Discuss why you took a year 
off to backpack through Europe, and what you got out of the experience. What 
are your biggest weaknesses? Every candidate knows how to answer this 
question: Just pick a theoretical weakness and magically transform that flaw into 
a strength in disguise! For example: "My biggest weakness is getting so absorbed 
in my work that I lose all track of time. Every day I look up and realize everyone 
has gone home! I know I should be more aware of the clock, but when I love what 
I'm doing I just can't think of anything else." So your "biggest weakness" is that 
you'll put in more hours than everyone else? Great. What are your biggest 
strengths? I'm not sure why interviewers ask this question; your resume and 
experience should make your strengths readily apparent! Even so, if you're asked, 
provide a sharp, on-point answer. Be clear and precise! If you're a great problem 
solver, don't just say that: Provide a few examples, pertinent to the opening, 
that prove you're a great problem solver! If you're an emotionally intelligent 
leader, don't just say that!</p>
